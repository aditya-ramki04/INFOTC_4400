INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROGRAM 2

Since we have a dataset of 5000 numbers I didnt use the ReadLine method that would take forever to input each number
Instead I just used file reading and read from the case8.in file from your testdata folder
I put case8.in file in the bin/debug folder so just regularly running the program should work
In the program I did print out the full sorted array
The last line shows the elapsed time for quicksort in milliseconds
I found the stopwatch class on the internet
